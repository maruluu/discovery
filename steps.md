Commit initial config
	unnecessary, just use yo angular and editorconfig/gitignore etc handled for you.

yo angular 
	no to all options other than angular-resource.
	still have to install angular-mocks
	grunt server works fine for preview
	we could be saying Ctrl + C kills the server properly

I now want to use Pure
	bower search pure
	bower install pure
	Still wish we could auto-wire this up.
	Wish we could just have access to Pure.css or pure.min.css
	Ahh. So you can get it. Just need to npm install and grunt build - could be clearer.
